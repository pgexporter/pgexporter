# pgexporter configuration

The configuration is loaded from either the path specified by the `-c` flag or `/etc/pgexporter/pgexporter.conf`.

The configuration of `pgexporter` is split into sections using the `[` and `]` characters.

The main section, called `[pgexporter]`, is where you configure the overall properties
of `pgexporter`.

Other sections doesn't have any requirements to their naming so you can give them
meaningful names like `[primary]` for the primary [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
instance.

All properties are in the format `key = value`.

The characters `#` and `;` can be used for comments; must be the first character on the line.
The `Bool` data type supports the following values: `on`, `1`, `true`, `off`, `0` and `false`.

See a [sample](./etc/pgexporter.conf) configuration for running `pgexporter` on `localhost`.

# pgexporter_users configuration

The `pgexporter_users` configuration defines the users known to the system. This file is created and managed through
the `pgexporter-admin` tool.

The configuration is loaded from either the path specified by the `-u` flag or `/etc/pgexporter/pgexporter_users.conf`.

# pgexporter_admins configuration

The `pgexporter_admins` configuration defines the administrators known to the system. This file is created and managed through
the `pgexporter-admin` tool.

The configuration is loaded from either the path specified by the `-A` flag or `/etc/pgexporter/pgexporter_admins.conf`.

If pgexporter has both Transport Layer Security (TLS) and `management` enabled then `pgexporter-cli` can
connect with TLS using the files `~/.pgexporter/pgexporter.key` (must be 0600 permission),
`~/.pgexporter/pgexporter.crt` and `~/.pgexporter/root.crt`.
