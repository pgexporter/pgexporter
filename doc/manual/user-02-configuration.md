# Configuration

The configuration is loaded from either the path specified by the `-c` flag or `/etc/pgexporter/pgexporter.conf`.

The configuration of [**pgexporter**][pgexporter] is split into sections using the `[` and `]` characters.

The main section, called `[pgexporter]`, is where you configure the overall properties of [**pgexporter**][pgexporter].

Other sections doesn't have any requirements to their naming so you can give them meaningful names like `[primary]` for the primary [PostgreSQL][postgresql] instance.

All properties are in the format `key = value`.

The characters `#` and `;` can be used for comments; must be the first character on the line.

The `Bool` data type supports the following values: `on`, `yes`, `1`, `true`, `off`, `no`, `0` and `false`.

See a [sample][sample] configuration for running [**pgexporter**][pgexporter] on `localhost`.

## [pgexporter]

| Property              |Default|Unit  |Required| Description |
|-----------------------|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| host | | String | Yes | The bind address for pgexporter |
| unix_socket_dir | | String | Yes | The Unix Domain Socket location |
| metrics | | Int | Yes | The metrics port |
| metrics_path | | String | No | Path to customized metrics (either a YAML file or a directory with YAML files) |
| metrics_cache_max_age | 0 | String | No | The number of seconds to keep in cache a Prometheus (metrics) response. If set to zero, the caching will be disabled. Can be a string with a suffix, like `2m` to indicate 2 minutes |
| metrics_cache_max_size | 256k | String | No | The maximum amount of data to keep in cache when serving Prometheus responses. Changes require restart. This parameter determines the size of memory allocated for the cache even if `metrics_cache_max_age` or `metrics` are disabled. Its value, however, is taken into account only if `metrics_cache_max_age` is set to a non-zero value. Supports suffixes: 'B' (bytes), the default if omitted, 'K' or 'KB' (kilobytes), 'M' or 'MB' (megabytes), 'G' or 'GB' (gigabytes).|

| bridge_cache_max_size | `10M` | String | No | The maximum amount of data to keep in cache when serving bridge responses. Changes require restart. This parameter determines the size of memory allocated for the cache even if `bridge_cache_max_age` or `bridge` are disabled. Its value, however, is taken into account only if `bridge_cache_max_age` is set to a non-zero value. Supports suffixes: 'B' (bytes), the default if omitted, 'K' or 'KB' (kilobytes), 'M' or 'MB' (megabytes), 'G' or 'GB' (gigabytes).|

Allowed settings are: `never` (or `off`), does not update the process title; `strict` to set the process title without overriding the existing initial process title length; `minimal` to set the process title to the base description; `verbose` (or `full`) to set the process title to the full description. Please note that `strict` and `minimal` are honored only on those systems that do not provide a native way to set the process title (e.g., Linux). On other systems, there is no difference between `strict` and `minimal` and the assumed behaviour is `minimal` even if `strict` is used. `never` and `verbose` are always honored, on every system. On Linux systems the process title is always trimmed to 255 characters, while on system that provide a natve way to set the process title it can be longer. |

Note, that PostgreSQL 13+ is required.

Note, that if `host` starts with a `/` it represents a path and [**pgexporter**][pgexporter] will connect using a Unix Domain Socket.

## pgexporter_users configuration

The `pgexporter_users` configuration defines the users known to the system. This file is created and managed through the `pgexporter-admin` tool.

The configuration is loaded from either the path specified by the `-u` flag or `/etc/pgexporter/pgexporter_users.conf`.

## pgexporter_admins configuration

The `pgexporter_admins` configuration defines the administrators known to the system. This file is created and managed through the `pgexporter-admin` tool.

The configuration is loaded from either the path specified by the `-A` flag or `/etc/pgexporter/pgexporter_admins.conf`.

If pgexporter has both Transport Layer Security (TLS) and `management` enabled then `pgexporter-cli` can connect with TLS using the files `~/.pgexporter/pgexporter.key` (must be 0600 permission), `~/.pgexporter/pgexporter.crt` and `~/.pgexporter/root.crt`.
